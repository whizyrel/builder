            Hi! This wasn't built to be extremely smart. It was just written for the purpose of ease in making the json file. Please be cautious as you use it (the verses could be messed up if order is not fullowed).
        </div>
        <div>
           <div>
                <h4>Order:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Enter book title like Genesis...</li>
                    <li>Chapter No then add button to add it.</li>
                    <li>Paste verse and click to add it.</li>
                    <li>
                        When you are through with a chapter you could add another chapter with the respective button below and contine with adding verses to the newly added chapter in the usual way. When you are through (adding verses to the chapter), use the submit button to save it and the download button to download it.

                    </li>
                </ol>
           </div>
            <div>
                <h4><span>Warning:</span></h4>
                <div>
                    It is volatile! On refreshing this page you would have to start all over again! Please be careful
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            Maybe not the best solution but with relative ease of use. Thanks a lot! I appreciate your contribution.
